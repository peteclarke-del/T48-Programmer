"""Check for, download and install a newer release of T48 Programmer itself.

The check runs only when the user asks for it, from the About window. It
reads the release GitHub marks as the latest and compares its tag,
``vX.Y.Z``, with ``__version__``.

A release carries a Debian package for each system it is built for and a
``SHA256SUMS`` file for all of its files. packaging/package-target.sh names
the package files, and an installed package records the name of its own file,
with the version left as ``{version}``, in ``package-target`` beside the
application. The update takes the file with that name from the newer release,
so it installs the package made for the same distribution release and
architecture. The package is downloaded to the cache folder, checked against
``SHA256SUMS`` and installed with ``pkexec apt-get install``, which asks for
the user's password. A copy run from the source tree, or installed from the
wheel, has no ``package-target`` and cannot update itself; the release page
is offered instead.
